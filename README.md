# Impacts on Society

The course I teach is called Data Science. It is an Algebra 2 equivalent at my high school, which means that it is mostly students in grades 11 and 12. In my Data Science course we use the YouCubed Explorations in Data Science curriculum which aims to expose students to the main ideas in data science using mainly free tools like Google Sheets and developing students’ understanding of data science concepts through project based units. At the end of the course students have developed a comprehensive portfolio of their work.

Computing, while originally being fairly inclusive of women, and even some minorities, over time has become a field dominated by white males. This was in part due to the fact that during the early 80’s computers were marketed mainly to boys. Because the computing field is lacking diversity, our culture is missing out on possible synergy from having diverse people’s perspectives and experiences included in the creation of applications.

While computing has unarguably benefited society in many ways, from allowing access to vast amounts of information to people all across the world, increasing speed and ease of communication, and allowing for incredible innovations in safety and health, there are also negative impacts. An example is algorithms being used without appropriate care given to the defects or opacity. This could be as personal as a person being given a longer jail sentence due to an algorithm or as wide ranging as a social media platform algorithm highlighting salacious rumors that then overtake research based journalism. 

In this plan I will describe a lesson that I have created to incorporate computing impacts on society into my course. The YouCubed curriculum already incorporates an opportunity in each unit to consider the ethical implications of each project the students complete. Many of the projects are also designed to inform students of how computing applications that they interact with in their daily lives actually work. My plan is to extend this by having students investigate a particular application that they are interested in further.

One thing that is important to consider as a teacher is how we can encourage students of all backgrounds to get involved in the content. This is particularly true of computer science related classes, as fields related to computer science are in need of a much more diverse pool of future professionals. Providing the opportunity for choice allows students to focus their learning on things of importance to their own lives and increases relevance. By allowing students to choose their own topic for investigation I am limiting some of the effect of my own notions of what is interesting on what the students learn about.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives:

In this lesson, students will be able to identify and describe a commonly used application or service, like Google, Netflix, TikTok, etc.. They will create a presentation summarizing the key features of the application. Then students will evaluate the application based on its impacts on society at large or on individuals who may use the application. Finally, students will consider how the application could be improved to minimize negative impacts.

### Materials:

Students will need access to the internet as well as a presentation software like Google Slides or Powerpoint.

### Introduction:

Students will be given the following image and asked what they notice and what they wonder.

After a class discussion, students will be given the assignment information detailing the components of the presentation which will be the assessment for the lesson.The assignment information will detail how students are to choose, research, and ultimately create their presentation, including::
Things to consider when choosing a computing application or service
Researching how it works, how it is used, parameters and pervasiveness, key features (including those that differentiate it from similar applications), and social/societal/individual impacts
Instructions for what to include in the presentation
Reflection questions for students to consider what they have learned and respond to it by providing ideas for how this application or service could be improved to minimize negative impacts and/or increase positive impacts on society or individuals.

### Student Work Time:

Students will be given sufficient work time, resources, and teacher assistance in completing the aspects of the assignment. After a sufficient time, students will be required to share their presentation with another student (and up to 3) to receive feedback using the rubric. After receiving feedback, students will refine their work before submitting the final presentations to the teacher.

### Presentations:

Students will be asked to share their presentations with the entire class. During this time they will receive additional feedback from their peers.

### Evaluation:

The final evaluation will be done by the teacher using the rubric based on the contents of the presentation (written).

### Outcomes:

This lesson will facilitate inclusion by allowing for students to choose applications of relevance in their own lives. It will also give them the opportunity to reflect on how they would change things should they pursue a career in computing and equip them with resources and skills for assessing impact of computing applications and services. This lesson in conjunction with the projects in the YouCubed curriculum will increase relevance for students and encourage them to see the possibilities in their own future for computer science related careers. Ultimately I hope that it will make them feel as though they have something to provide the field of computing: their own unique background, perspective, and insights.

## Conclusions:

Although this is meant to be a one-time lesson, it could be used at various points in the year, revisited, and improved since there is an unlimited amount of applications and services students could choose to research. After the initial time it is completed the teacher would make adjustments to the instructions and rubric, refining them to improve the outcomes desired based on the presentations the students completed.
